# Sentiment Analysis

## Description

This project underscores the potential of neural networks in deciphering text-based emotions. A feed-forward neural network was iteratively built in google colab using Python's tensorflow package. The primary goal was to classify tweets based on sentiment: sadness, love, joy, anger, fear, & suprise. Despite modest performance gains, the study highlights avenues for future exploration, including the integration of sequential context and more complex model architectures to enhance predictive accuracy and robustness.


## Data 

Orginal data obtained from Kaggle no longer exists, but a similar set can be found [here](https://huggingface.co/datasets/dair-ai/emotion). Vector embeddings generated with BERT on high throughput computing (4+GB).
